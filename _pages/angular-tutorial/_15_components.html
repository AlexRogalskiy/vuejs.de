<p>little what</p>
A component is a structual helper to organise our application.

<h3>Warum</h3>
Components are the fundamental building blocks of an angular application.
The concept of a component helps us to create a strategy how to seperate our frontend.
They help us to devide every aspect of our application into small and maintainable software-components.
Even the application itself is a component.

<h3>Was</h3>
A component consists of two main parts that help us to split different concerns.

First there is the component class that defines the data structure and behavior of a specific component.
This class is a plain implementation of your business logic.

The second part is the @Component decorator that connects your plain business logic to Angular.
In this decorator we configure angular specific details about the component.

Code Example
<code>
  @Component({
    selector: 'book-list',
    template: `
      <h1>
        Book-Title: {{title}}
      </h1>
    `
  })
  class BookListComponent {
    title: string;
    constructor() {
      this.title = 'An awesome book';
    }
  }
</code>

Let's take a look at these components in detail.

<h4>@Component Decorator</h4>
The @Component Decorator is used to setup metadata and the configuration of a specific component.
There are many and powerful possibilites to configure components for different needs.
At this point we'll focus on the basic two options `select` and `template` respective `templateUrl` if we want to link a file.

<code>
    @Component({
      selector: 'book-detail',
      templateUrl: './book-detail.html'
    })
    export class BookDetailComponent {}
</code>
